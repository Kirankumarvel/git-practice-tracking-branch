Welcome to the **Git Practice: Tracking Branch** repository!  
This project is designed to help you understand and practice how Git tracking branches work between your local and remote repositories.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Initializing a Git repository
- Creating and pushing local branches
- Setting upstream (tracking) branches
- Handling `git pull` and `git push` errors
- Resolving merge and rebase conflicts
- Best practices for branch management

## ðŸš€ Commands Practiced

### Initialize Repository
```bash
git init
```

### Create a Branch and Switch
```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

### Set Upstream (Tracking Branch)
```bash
git push -u origin branch-name
```

### Rebase Changes
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### Handle Merge Conflicts
(Resolve conflicts manually, then stage changes and continue rebasing)
```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

### Delete a Branch
```bash
git branch -d branch-name        # Delete locally
git branch -D branch-name        # Force delete locally
```
